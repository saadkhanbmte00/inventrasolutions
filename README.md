## 🛠 Make it yours — replace these placeholders

Search the project for each token and replace it:

| Placeholder | Where | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| `hello@inventra.dev` | contact.html, footers | your real email |
| `+1 (000) 000-0000` / `tel:+10000000000` | contact.html | your phone / WhatsApp |
| `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` | contact.html (`data-access-key`) | your Web3Forms key (below) |
| `#` in social links (`aria-label="LinkedIn"`, etc.) | every footer + contact.html | your real social URLs |
| `REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-DOMAIN` | sitemap.xml, robots.txt, index.html JSON-LD | your live URL |
| Stats, services, projects, testimonials, blog copy | the HTML pages | your real numbers & content |

### Contact form (2-minute setup)
1. Go to **https://web3forms.com**, enter your email, get a free **Access Key**.
2. In `contact.html`, set `data-access-key="YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY"` to that key.
3. Done — submissions arrive in your inbox. *Until you add a key, the form opens the visitor's
   email app pre-filled (so it still works).*

### Change the colors
All theming lives in CSS variables at the top of `assets/css/style.css` under `:root`
(`--cyan`, `--blue`, `--violet`, `--bg`, `--grad`, …). Change those and the whole site updates.

---

## 👀 Preview locally
Any static server works. With PowerShell (no installs needed):
```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File dev-server.ps1   # then open http://localhost:8123
```
Or just double-click `index.html` (the contact form's live submit needs http, not file://).

---

## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages (free)

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g. `inventrasolutions`).
2. From this folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "INVENTRA website"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/inventrasolutions.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.**
   The included workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) publishes automatically on every push.
4. Your site goes live at `https://<you>.github.io/inventrasolutions/`.
   *(For a clean root URL, name the repo `<you>.github.io`.)*

After it's live, update `REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-DOMAIN` in `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and the
JSON-LD block in `index.html` to your real URL.

### Other hosts
- **Netlify / Cloudflare Pages:** drag-and-drop this folder, or connect the repo. No settings needed.
- **Vercel:** import the repo (framework preset = “Other”). No build command.

---

## 🔐 Admin panel (token login — works on GitHub Pages, no extra services)

A self-contained admin lives at **`/admin/`**. It needs **no Decap, no OAuth app, no Worker**:

1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**.
   - **Repository access:** Only select repositories → this repo.
   - **Permissions → Repository → Contents: Read and write.**
   - Generate and copy the token.
2. Open **`/admin/`** on your live site, paste the token, confirm the repo, **Connect to GitHub**.
3. Edit **Business details**, **Projects** and **Blog**, hit **Save**. Each save commits to the
   repo via the GitHub API, and GitHub Pages redeploys the site in ~1 minute.

The pages render `content/*.json` (settings, projects, blog) via `assets/js/cms.js`, so your
edits appear live; the static HTML stays as a no-JS fallback. Your token is stored **only in your
browser** (localStorage) and used solely with GitHub's API — nothing is sent anywhere else.

> Tip: a **fine-grained** token scoped to this one repo with only *Contents* access is safest.
> You can revoke/rotate it anytime from the same GitHub settings page.

## 📝 Notes
- For best social-share previews, export `assets/img/og.svg` to a 1200×630 **PNG** named `og.png`
  and update the `og:image` paths (some scrapers don't render SVG).
- The site is intentionally framework-free so it stays fast and easy to edit by hand.
